# Introduction

This is code for a study of common PLMs and detailed evaluation on the same datasets.

Here, we attempt to run the following protein models on CAMEO and CASP14 datasets to get results that can be processed into TM Scores:

* ESMFold (validate paper results )
* ProtT5 
* ProstT5
* Ankh
* Seqvec

We already have rules of :

* AlphaFold2 (single)
* AlphaFold2 (full)
